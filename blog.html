							<h1>ANSWER TO KARL FABEL's PUZZLE - 28th December, 2018</h1>
							The answer to the chess puzzle is to move the rook on G6 to C6. While that does put a discovered check on the
							black king from the bishop, notice that black rook on B7 can simply eliminate the bishop on H7, hence prolonging
							the game. This puzzle is considered to be one of the more trickier ones to solve. If you were able to solve it,
							congratulations!<br><br>

							<h1>THE PATH WE ALL TOOK - 28th December, 2018</h1>
							<img src="images/humanity.jpg" width=100%>
							Humans dominate the earth, at least in terms of how much they use the earth's resources, how ubiquitous is their
							presence, and how much damage they can do to the geological and ecological biospheres of earth.<br><br> Homo
							Sapiens Sapiens, is currently the only extant Human Specie on the surface of the earth. Just a few millennia
							ago, our cousins, the Neanderthals also co-existed along with us. Why then, is it that only we have survived the
							test of time? The answer does not lie within the realms of genetic superiority, but of cultural superiority. One
							can argue that the Homo Neanderthal is slightly stronger, and has better agility and tool-building skills than
							our own Specie. But no one can argue that it is ultimately the Homo Sapiens who dominated the earth. The reason
							for this, is that we believed in "us". Homo Sapiens was the first and only species to have developed the concept
							of faith in a power greater than their own, a power which rules over all of them and hence they feel united
							within the power's presence.<br><br> Let us imagine the following scenario - 50 Neanderthals living in 5
							independent groups of 10 people live in the area which we now call Kiev. 50 Sapiens composed of 5 independent
							groups of 10 people live adjacent to this area. All these 10 independent groups recognize each other's presence.
							Now say that this geological area is graced by the natural phenomenon of the Aurora Sky. The difference in the 5
							Neanderthals tribes and the 5 Sapiens tribe is that the Sapiens would unite during the occurrence of such a
							phenomenon, simply because they believe that some greater power is speaking to them. It is this very unified
							faith that brought about a cognitive revolution in the Sapiens, hence allowing them to unite into larger and
							larger groups. Even though these groups would have separate social systems and requirements of food, they would
							still recognize and value their brothers and sisters from the other groups simply because they also believe in
							the same greater power.<br><br> Such chance natural phenomenon, including rains, winds, and even natural
							structures such as mountains, rivers, allowed our ancestors to form larger groups and hence we started to form
							strength in numbers. Our potential weaknesses with respect to our cousins, the Neanderthals were now offset. If
							say a war were to break out between the 50 Neanderthals and the 50 Sapiens, we can be sure that although the
							Neanderthals are stronger and their larger fingers and brains allow them to make better use of their tools and
							weapons, it would be the Sapiens' coordinated warfare which would allow them to win. The Neanderthal refugees
							who surrender would either be included into the human tribes or killed off. Either way this explains why the
							Sapiens are dominant and why a small part of our genes is Neanderthal.<br><br> Fast forward to the era just 6
							millennia ago and we see that the common belief of millions of people in the same power (The Hindu Trinity üïâ,
							The Sun God Ra ‚òÄ, Lord Darus of Babylonia üçÅ) allowed our ancestors to form large empires. But Sapiens hadn't
							still reached the stage comparable to what we are now. During the nascent stages of these empires, the people
							believed that their empire is "us" and outsiders are "them", i.e. Different. What then created the bridge which
							allowed amazingly different cultures into a single universal entity? The answer is - Money. Until now, Sapiens
							would barter goods and services in exchange of goods and services. An Indian shoemaker who desired apples rather
							than bananas would offer a better trade for an apple farmer than a banana farmer. Trade while possible would be
							more limited due to the barter system. However, with the invention of money, people no longer needed to have
							separate exchange rates based on the supply and demand rates of the goods, but they just needed to know the
							exchange rates of the good with respect to a single unit of money. Money worked because everyone believed in the
							power of money, because everyone desired money. It was a slow process to finally reach the phase where the money
							was economical to create, store and transport, but 6 millennia ago, metallic coins and imprints had entered the
							human world.<br><br> The very concept of money united all humans who used money. Simply because everyone
							believed in it. Hence money represents the first stage of unification. The second stage of unification was the
							advent of Religion. While Sapiens have always believed in the natural and supernatural forces and united under
							its banner, it was only a few millennia ago, that elaborate religious systems were designed. These systems would
							describe rules of how humans are to live their lives and what is one's place in this world. Previously, two
							complete strangers could cooperate based on the exchange of money, but now they could experience a new and
							stronger brotherhood with each other. Just by knowing that their fellow human is a Muslim or a Christian, one
							could understand a great deal about their lives and rules. In other religions like Hinduism, the advent of the
							caste system would also describe the kind of work people do for a living. Hence religion would actually lead
							humans to form a deep level of understanding with complete‚Äã strangers and can be considered to be the next stage
							in unification. The final stage in the unification process arrived when mathematics and science ruled above us
							all. That moment, when Sapiens learnt humility in front of the cosmos was when they began to think that the
							poorest child in Africa and the Richest businessman in Europe are but two humans who are part of this infinite
							universe. Americans, Chinese, Indians and Algerians may all have separate units of money, and follow different
							religions, but the language of mathematics and science is common for all. These stages of unification were all
							slow and gradual, but they were crucial to bring humans to the stage we are now in. We may not have evolved
							biologically or genetically in the past few millennia, but we have evolved culturally. Our separate cultures
							were united first by the belief in natural phenomenon, followed by belief in empires, belief in money, belief in
							religion and finally belief in mathematical and scientific advancements. This leads us to ask the question -
